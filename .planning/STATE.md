# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-08)

**Core value:** Users can import key photographs, arrange them into timed sequences with FX layers, preview in real-time, and export as PNG image sequences -- the complete stop-motion-to-cinema pipeline must work end-to-end.
**Current focus:** Phase 34: Standalone Demo Shell

## Current Position

Phase: 34 of 37 (Standalone Demo Shell)
Plan: TBD
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-08 — Roadmap created for v0.8.0 Standalone Physics Paint

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v0.8.0: efx-physic-paint must be proven as a standalone interactive physics paint app/window before editor integration.
- v0.8.0: Physics paint is an additional tool; it does not replace perfect-freehand basic paint or p5.brush FX paint.
- v0.8.0: Failed headless adapter/batch replay remains excluded; future integration seam is typed/contract-only in this milestone.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Editor integration | EFX editor layer integration, Tauri child-window IPC, `.mce` persistence, cached compositing | Deferred to future milestone | v0.8.0 scope |
| Architecture | Headless batch adapter replay / editor-driven renderFromStrokes / forceDryAll path | Excluded | v0.7.0 failure post-mortem |
