# Roadmap: EFX-Motion Editor

## Overview

EFX-Motion Editor goes from zero to a complete stop-motion-to-cinema pipeline. v0.1.0 (Phases 1-7) shipped the complete editing experience. v0.2.0 (Phases 8-14) extended the editor with keyframe animation, GPU blur, content overlays, transitions, and multi-format export. v0.3.0 (Phases 15-17) added audio import with waveforms and beat sync, GLSL shader effects and transitions, solid sequences with gradients, and a streamlined 2-panel adaptive sidebar. v0.4.0 (Phases 18-19) added After Effects-style canvas motion path editing and frame-by-frame paint/rotopaint layers with onion skinning. v0.5.0 (Phases 20-21) added expressive brush rendering with spectral pigment mixing and per-layer GLSL velocity motion blur with sub-frame accumulation for export. v0.6.0 (Phases 22-25) added stroke management, bezier path editing, and paint workflow UX improvements. v0.7.0 (Phases 26-33) converted to a pnpm monorepo and enhanced the current paint engine with a 3-mode system, inline color picker, wireframe overlay, and stroke animation. v0.8.0 (Phase 34+) will add efx-physic-paint as a standalone window with transport to the editor.
